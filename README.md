# Database-Design
Naruto Anime is an entity which completely describes the show Naruto. It has different aspects that state the purpose of the show by its unique
identification number providing details like source, type and status of the show currently. This is mainly used by the group of people who have interest
in anime shows and it is helpful for the backend unit who build the show by getting to learn the statistical data about revenue and methods of
managing for a greater understanding and development of skills. This is an interactive module which provokes users (who are the viewers in our
case) to give the feedback in the form of rankings and reviews which displays the trend that provides an idea on the overview of maintaining
consistency.

The Databook Naruto consists of the entities NARUTO_ANIME, PRODUCER, RATING, GENRE, STUDIO, LICENSE, BROADCAST, STATS and
AWARDS. Each entity has its own unique identifier. The data from each entity gives us the attributes which are used in fetching the required
information.
